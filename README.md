# getting-and-cleaning-course-project

The goals of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The outcomes of this project are: 
-----------------------------------------------
1) a tidy data set named as "average_data.txt , 

2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 

and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

The raw data of this project are from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0, which include the following files

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
